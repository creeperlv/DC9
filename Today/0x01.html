<p>Today, Sep. 10, the Teachers' Day. We, students got some extra benefit that we've got 2 hours free, in ordere to let teachers more relax.</p>
<p>Up to now, I told the good news, but there are also some bad news to talk. It is shame that we didn't show our appreciation to our theacher even Mrs.Mi, so that Mrs.Mi is very sad. Classmates in Class 9, what should we do?</p>
